    title: "About Me"

    content: |-
      I am currently a PhD candidate at [INSA Lyon, France](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/en/). My thesis is being held in two laboratories: 
      
      1. [CETHIL](https://cethil.insa-lyon.fr/en/), center for energy and thermal sciences of Lyon.

      2. [LIRIS](https://liris.cnrs.fr/en), image and information systems laboratory.

      During my 5 years of engineering studies I had the opportunity to work on different projects, with different scopes : CFD / Energy optimization / Environmental policies / CAD / AI & Data.Sc.

      I conducted my MSc project at University College London (UCL) in the mechanical engineering department. My work consisted on designing and studying novel designs of microchannel heat sinks and to assess their thermo-hydraulic enhancement with nanofluids.

      I have been involved in various associations, and have acquired transversal skills in team management and IT projects.

      Given my academic background, I am always curious to work on and know more about the following subjects:

      1. Artificial intelligence and data science applied to the optimisation of energy systems.<br>

      2. Renewable energy production, conversion and storage systems.<br>

      3. Turbomachinery.<br>

      4. Numerical modelling, maths & probability.

          My work focused on two separate projects : 
          
          - The study, conception and design of microchannel heat sinks for power electronics. A state of art of the current advances have been made and novel designs were proposed and studied. Finally, the work also focused on the use of nanofluids to enhance the heat transfer.
          - The second project which is an experimental work consisted on the construction of a double-shell calorimeter for highly efficient power converters.
