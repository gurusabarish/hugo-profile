    content: |-
      I am currently a PhD student at INSA Lyon. I work on multi-criteria predictive control optimization of distributed energy systems, using physics-based & probabilistic machine learning approaches. 

      During my 5 years of engineering studies I had the opportunity to work on different projects, with different scopes : CFD / Energy optimization / Environmental policies / CAD / AI & Data.Sc.

      I conducted my MSc project at University College London (UCL) in the mechanical engineering department. My work consisted on designing and studying novel designs of microchannel heat sinks and to assess their thermo-hydraulic enhancement with nanofluids.

      I have been involved in various associations, and have acquired transversal skills in team management and IT projects.

      Please feel free to contact me for a discussion or if you need any further information about my career. I am always happy to meet new people! 

      I am currently working on a project that will be used to help people find the best way to get around the city.
